# Wild Compare

This project is designed to compare two strings using wildcard characters. The main goal is to determine if the two strings match, considering the wildcard characters.

Write a function that compares two strings and returns 1 if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise return 0.

Prototype: int wildcmp(char *s1, char*s2);
s2 can contain the special character *.
The special char* can replace any string (including an empty string)
